                    <p>An illustrator at heart, I like trying my hand at new mediums all the time.<br>
                        Although they don't all stick, I've found a few favorites over the years.<br>
                        These include film photography, anything to do with paper craft, and painting.<br>
                        <br>
                        Bicycles are another part of my life that started solely as a means to commute to work, <br>
                        but after friends introduced me to public rides and races, <br>
                        I've really come to enjoy cycling with people or alone to new & old places.
